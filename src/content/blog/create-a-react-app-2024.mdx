This article aims to be a simple, straightforward guide to setting up a react application in 2024. If you would just like to clone a repository with this setup, you can find the code [here](https://vitejs.dev).

## Scaffold

To scaffold our react app, we will use [vite](https://vitejs.dev), a modern JavaScript build tool. Run the below command, and step through the options. For framework choose **React** and for variant choose **Typescript + SWC**.

```text title="terminal"
npm create vite@latest
```

Once complete, run the below commands inside the new project directory to install dependencies and run your project.

```text title="terminal"
npm install

npm run dev
```

## Cleanup

Vite projects come with some starter files and code. We can clean this up before moving on with the next steps.
You can delete **App.tsx** and **assets/react.svg** and remove all code from **index.css**. Then update **App.tsx**, it should look like the below component.

```tsx title="App.tsx"
function App() {
	return (
		<div>
			<h1>Hello World</h1>
		</div>
	);
}

export default App;
```

## Styling

For styling, we will use [tailwind css](https://tailwindcss.com/), but this can be changed for other options - CSS modules, styled components etc.

To install and configure tailwind run the below commands.

```text wrap title="terminal"
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

This will create two files, **postcss.config.js** and **tailwind.config.js**.

Add paths to the tailwimd config file and tailwind styles to your css file.

```js wrap title="tailwind.config.js"
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
export default {
	content: ['./index.html', './src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}'],
	theme: {
		extend: {}
	},
	plugins: []
};
```

<br />

```css title="tindex.css"
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

## Formatting and Linting

For formatting and linting, we will use [prettier](https://prettier.io/) and [eslint](https://eslint.org/).

### Prettier

To install prettier, run:

```text wrap title="terminal"
npm install --save-dev prettier
```

If using tailwind css, you can install a package to use prettier to format tailwind css classes.

```text wrap title="terminal"
npm install -D prettier prettier-plugin-tailwindcss
```

Once installed, create a **.prettierrc** file in the root of your project. In this file, we can put all the prettier config options we want to use. You can use the below options to get started. Read more about prettier config [here](https://prettier.io/docs/en/options).

```json title=".prettierrc"
{
	"useTabs": true,
	"singleQuote": true,
	"trailingComma": "none",
	"semi": true,
	"printWidth": 100,
	"plugins": ["prettier-plugin-tailwindcss"] // remove if not using tailwind css
}
```

### Eslint

To install and configure eslint, run:

```text title="terminal"
npm init @eslint/config
```

This command will give you a walk through setup, giving you different setup options. See the options I have used below, but feel free to read more [here](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/) and configure your project differently.

```text wrap title="terminal"
✔ How would you like to use ESLint? To check syntax, find problems, and enforce code style
✔ What type of modules does your project use? JavaScript modules (import/export)
✔ Which framework does your project use? react
✔ Does your project use TypeScript? Yes
✔ Where does your code run? browser
✔ How would you like to define a style for your project? style guide
✔ Which style guide do you want to follow? standard-with-typescript
✔ What format do you want your config file to be in? · JavaScript
```

Based on your selection above, you should be asked to install additional dependencies, select **yes** and they will be installed.

### Scripts

With prettier and eslint installed and configured, let's add scripts to the **package.json** file to use these packages.

```json title="package.json"
"scripts": {
	"lint": "eslint . --ext ts,tsx",
	"format": "prettier --check .",
	"format:fix": "prettier --write ."
}
```

<InfoBox>
	If your are using VsCode. You can configure eslint to highlight errors in real time, and configure
	vs code to format on file save. Install the prettier and eslint plugins, and for Prettier set
	default formatter to Prettier and go to preferences and tick **Editor: Format On Save**.
</InfoBox>

## Testing

For testing, I prefer to use [cypress](https://www.cypress.io), but you can skip this step if you would like to use another library.

To install cypress, run:

```text wrap title="terminal"
npm install cypress --save-dev
```

After cypress is installed, you can add the following scripts to your app

```json title="package.json"
"scripts": {
	"cypress:open": "cypress open",
	"cypress:run": "cypress run",
	"cypress:run:component": "cypress run --component",
	"cypress:run:e2e": "cypress run --e2e",
}
```

Run the first script to go through an interactive setup of cypress unit and/or end to end testing.

```text wrap title="terminal"
npm install cypress:open
```

## Pre Commit

Finally lets make sure our code is formatted and linted before we commit code. To do this, lets install [husky](https://www.cypress.io). **This package needs a git repository to work**
To set husky up, run the following command:

```text wrap title="terminal"
npx husky init
```

When this command is complete, it will create a **.husky** folder. You can configure your pre commit checks by changing the **pre-commit** file. See below a sample that can be used for this project. This will check and fix formatting, run eslint, and run tests. If eslint or any tests fail, it will cancel the commit.

```text wrap title="terminal"
npm run format:fix
npm run lint
npm run cypress:run
```
