import Carousel from '../../components/content-components/carousel/carousel.astro';

## The scenario

You are building a website / app, and you find that you need a carousel to display some images. Your first thought may be to find a package on npm, intall and use it. Unless you need extended functionality, this is probably unnecessary. I will show you how you can build the below carousel with 13 lines of CSS.

<Carousel />

## HTML

The html is pretty straight forward. We have a container div and inside we have an img tag for each image in our carousel.

```html
<div class="slide-container">
	<img
		src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/2382681/pexels-photo-2382681.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=2"
		class="slide"
	/>
	<img
		src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/1650882/pexels-photo-1650882.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=2"
		class="slide"
	/>
	...repeat with other images
</div>
```

## CSS

Lets start with the container.

```css
.slide-container {
	display: flex;
	gap: 2rem;
	overflow: scroll;
	scroll-behavior: smooth;
	scroll-snap-type: x mandatory;
}

.slide-container::-webkit-scrollbar {
	display: none;
}
```

We start by using **flex** to put our images in a row, give a **gap** between each image of **2 rem**, and set the **overflow** to **scroll**, so we can move left to write to see each image as we scroll. <br />
The next two properties you may have not seen before, but are straightforward.
We set the **scroll-behavior** to **smooth** which does what you would expect, and the **scroll-snap-type** ensures that any scrolling will scroll to the next image. You can try this example without these properties to see the difference. <br />

And finally we hide the scrollbar.

Now lets add the styling for each slide (image).

```css
.slide {
	width: 80%;
	min-width: 80%;
	height: 300px;
	border-radius: 1rem;
	object-fit: cover;
	scroll-snap-align: center;
	scroll-snap-stop: always;
}
```

Again, there isn't anything out of the ordinary here, except maybe the last two lines.

We start by setting the **width** and **height** for our images (I have used 80% so that we can see the other image partially, but if you want full width carousel, you can set the widths to 100%). We then set our **border-radius** to make those nice rounded borders (feel free to make these as rounded as you like, or remove the property for straight corners), and set the **object-fit** property to **cover** so our image stretches and coers the available space.

The last two properties:

Setting the **scroll-snap-align** to center will ensure that as you scroll, slides with an slide on either side will always scroll to the center. <br />
The property **scroll-snap-stop** ensures that when scrolling, it stops at the next scroll item (try removing this and you can scroll across multiple slides)
